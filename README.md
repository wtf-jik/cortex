This project is abandoned. Obsidian is not the appropriate platform to build this on. Although "everything is a file" is a very user friendly philosphy, it creates a bottleneck when dealing with many scattered data reads simultaneously.

Additionally, this name was obviously too good of a name to go unused in this space and I have learned that a large corporation already sells a product by this name. Rather than roleplay as a target for their legal team, I'm gonna just can it here.

This will return in another form.
